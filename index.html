According to a report in 2008 by National Institute of Justice, up to 60 percent of formerly incarcerated individuals remain jobless a year after their release because of their criminal records and low literacy levels. Employment rates and earnings histories of people in prisons and jails are often low before incarceration as a result of limited education experiences and low skill levels.</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-justify">Studies show that there is a powerful relationship between unemployment and recidivism rate among formerly incarcerated individuals.  Locked out of gainful employment opportunities, many formerly incarcerated individuals fall back to substance abuse or engage in criminal activities.  According to 2008 report by the Urban Institute, "Individuals who made more than $10 an hour were half as likely to return to prison as those making less than $7 an hour."</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-justify">In 2011 report by the Pew Center, the growth in prison population in America came with a substantial cost, with annual State and Federal expenditures on corrections growing by 305% during past two decades, to the total of approximately $52 billion.  According to this report, if 10 states with the highest recidivism rates reduced their rates by 10%, they could save more than $470 million a year.</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-justify">Today, employment opportunities are growing  for those who possess high-tech skills such as software engineering and data science as the use of information technology expands in many industries.  All the while, blue-collar jobs are disappearing due to overseas outsourcing and automation.  This trend is particularly problematic for incarcerated individuals who will face formidable employment challenges due to their conviction records and the lack of skills applicable in jobs that are less susceptible to automation and outsourcing.  </p>
            <p class="text-muted text-justify">Inspired by successes of The Last Mile in California and Code4000 in the UK that educated  incarcerated individuals to become productive web developers, Coders Beyond Bars will launch a pilot program to offer Introduction to Data Science course in a correctional facility in Boston, Massachusetts with the aim of teaching  practical skills such as computer programming, data visualization, and database management to prepare students for entry-level data science positions.</p>
            <p class="text-muted text-justify">American economy faces a shortage of 180,000 employees with data analytical skills, and this shortage is particularly acute in Boston due to concentration of high-tech industries.  Our aim is to address this shortage in the supply of talent in data analytics skills by educating incarcerated individuals in those skills and connecting them with companies that boldly seek prospective employees from an alternative pool of talents.</p>
